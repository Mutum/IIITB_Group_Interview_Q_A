spark performance tuning
1]  spark.sql.shuffle.partitions 
By default Spark SQL uses spark.sql.shuffle.partitions number of partitions for aggregations and joins, i.e. 200 by default.
That often leads to explosion of partitions for nothing that does impact the performance of a query since these 200 tasks (per partition) have all to start and finish before you get the result.
